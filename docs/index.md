# Welcome!

If you're ready to learn how to program in JavaScript, and I mean *really* program in JavaScript, you've come to the right place.

My goal here is not just to teach you the JavaScript language, but to help you become a solid programmer and build the foundation for a lifelong journey into the world of software engineering.

## Knowing the language isn't enough

Anyone can learn the basics of a programming language and think of themselves as a "programmer," but in reality it takes a lot more than just knowing a language. You must also learn how to design programs well, how to write maintainable, modular code, and how to use the most efficient and effective algorithms and data structures to get the job done.

This course is designed to give you exactly those skills.

## What makes this course different

Most "learn to program" courses don't have what it takes to give you a real foundation for success. They'll teach you the basics of a language, sure, and you'll do some coding along and build some projects that may even look really nice, but when it comes to designing and building things on your own... forget it.

I'm going to take you from writing your very first line of code to building complex programs that do more than you ever thought yourself capable of. You won't just learn how to write code; you'll learn how to think like an engineer and apply the very same skills and techniques people pay thousands of dollars for at a bootcamp or in a college degree program...

And it won't cost you a dime.

## It won't be easy

I'm not gonna lie; this is going to be a lot of work. Learning how to program *the right way* is a damned difficult thing to do. There will be times when you'll be so frustrated you just want to quit.

I'm going to tell you right now that, while those moments are incredibly frustrating, they're also necessary&mdash;and they're the moments that will lead you to your biggest, most satisfying breakthroughs! The path to mastery can *only* be reached by riding the struggle bus. And when you have your breakthrough... well, it's a hell of a feeling. You'll see what I mean.
