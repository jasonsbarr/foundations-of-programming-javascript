<h1 id="welcome">Welcome!</h1>
<p>If you're ready to learn how to program in JavaScript, and I mean <em>really</em> program in JavaScript, you've come to the right place.</p>
<p>My goal here is not just to teach you the JavaScript language, but to help you become a solid programmer and build the foundation for a lifelong journey into the world of software engineering.</p>
<h2 id="knowing-the-language-isnt-enough">Knowing the language isn't enough</h2>
<p>Anyone can learn the basics of a programming language and think of themselves as a "programmer," but in reality it takes a lot more than just knowing a language. You must also learn how to design programs well, how to write maintainable, modular code, and how to use the most efficient and effective algorithms and data structures to get the job done.</p>
<p>This course is designed to give you exactly those skills.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-this-course-different">What makes this course different</h2>
<p>Most "learn to program" courses don't have what it takes to give you a real foundation for success. They'll teach you the basics of a language, sure, and you'll do some coding along and build some projects that may even look really nice, but when it comes to designing and building things on your own... forget it.</p>
<p>I'm going to take you from writing your very first line of code to building complex programs that do more than you ever thought yourself capable of. You won't just learn how to write code; you'll learn how to think like an engineer and apply the very same skills and techniques people pay thousands of dollars for at a bootcamp or in a college degree program...</p>
<p>And it won't cost you a dime.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-course-is-structured">How the course is structured</h2>
<p>This course is designed to help you learn, and I mean <em>really</em> learn. There are numerous quizzes, Feynman exercises (where you explain what you're learning in your own words), and programming exercises from beginning to end.</p>
<p>There are also some code-alongs and guided projects where I demonstrate how to design and build more complex programs.</p>
<p>Then there are actual, do-it-yourself-for-real projects where I'll give you the project specification, maybe some starter files, and then it's up to you to build it.</p>
<p>Quizzes and exercises are all cumulative and everything builds on earlier material, which gives me a chance to use spaced repetition throughout the course. That means I can repeat concepts and important information to maximize your opportunity to make sure the concepts get firmly embedded in your memory.</p>
<p>Finally, a comprehensive assessment gauges your progress over the entire course and a massive final project lets you demonstrate everything you've learned. You could even use it as a portfolio piece once you're finished!</p>
<h2 id="it-wont-be-easy">It won't be easy</h2>
<p>I'm not gonna lie; this is going to be a lot of work. Learning how to program <em>the right way</em> is a damned difficult thing to do. There will be times when you'll be so frustrated you just want to quit.</p>
<p>I'm going to tell you right now that, while those moments are incredibly frustrating, they're also necessary&mdash;and they're the moments that will lead you to your biggest, most satisfying breakthroughs! The path to mastery can <em>only</em> be reached by riding the struggle bus. And when you have your breakthrough... well, it's a hell of a feeling. You'll see what I mean.</p>
<h2 id="course-requirements">Course requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>You need to use a modern browser, preferably on a desktop or laptop computer, to do the code exercises and projects.<ul>
<li>This means a recent (preferably the latest) version of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari.</li>
<li>It's not impossible to use a tablet, but you'll be <em>much</em> better off with a full-size keyboard. Trust me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you want to use your own code editor for projects and exercises, I'll provide links to the repository files so you can download them.<ul>
<li>It's not necessary, though, because everything you need will be embedded in the pages here.</li>
<li>That includes code editors, exercises, project starter files... <strong>everything</strong>!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most importantly, you need to have a desire to learn, a willingness to be taught, and the drive to keep pushing when you hit the wall and things get hard. Take a break, take a walk around the block, take a cigarette break (don't do that, smoking is bad for you), or whatever you need to let your mind get unstuck, then come back and look at the problem again with fresh eyes and a ready mind.</li>
</ul>
